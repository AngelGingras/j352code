<p><a href="https://navient.com/" target="_blank">
Navient Corporation</a>, a prominent federal student loan servicer, has been entangled in a number of lawsuits in recent years, most notably by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Jan. 2017, according to <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/" target="_blank">StudentLoanPlanner.com.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/" target="_blank">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, a government agency aimed at protecting citizens against financial entities, has received complaints against Navient every month since March 2012. Out of 74,318 of their total complaints regarding student loan debt, more than 42% involve Navient, with a peak in complaints filed the same month of the lawsuit. </p>
<br>

<br><br>

<p>The company accused Navient of the following charges:
<ul>
	<li>Failure to correctly apply or allocate borrower student loan payments to their accounts</li>
	<li>Steering struggling borrowers toward multiple forbearances instead of income-driven repayment plans</li>
	<li>Deceived private student loan borrowers about cosigner release requirements and reporting of loans incorrectly to the credit bureaus</li>
	<li>And more.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>While Navient upholds they did nothing wrong, the accusations are not far off from what the data shows. More than 50% of complaints against Navient are due to issues directly with the lender. This includes everything from poor customer service, bad advice from the consumer representative, lack of transparency about the loan terms, and disagreement of the fees charged.</p>

<p>Furthermore, lawsuits against Navient have originated outside of the Bureau as well. A group of state attorneys filed proceedings with similar accusations between 2017 and 2018, reaching a settlement in 2022, while a group of nine teachers filed a suit against Navient in Oct. 2018, reaching their settlement in 2020.</p>

<p>The lawsuit by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is still ongoing, with the latest complaint filed to the company on May 4, 2023.</p>
