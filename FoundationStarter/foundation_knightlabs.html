<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Hurricane Katrina developed from a tropical wave and tropical depression, and within five days intensified as it made its way to the gulf coast. The US governemnt had been expecting the storm and was able to declare a state of emergency, including shutting down infrastructure and enforcing evacuations within the two days of the storm's arrival. However, there was no way to know how serious the flooding would get.</p>
<h3>The Storm</h3>
<p>The storm hit Florida on Aug. 25 and entered the Gulf of Mexico a day later. It reached its peak as a Category 5 storm before hitting the gulf states on Aug. 29. It hit hardest in the city of New Orleans, where 80% of the city was submerged within 24 hours. The surge devastated the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, resulting in deaths as far north as Kentucky. </p>
<h3>The Aftermath</h3>
<p>Hurricane Katrina remains a pivotal part of American history, cited as the most destructive hurricanes in recent history and tied with Hurricane Harvey in 2017 as the costliest natural disaster. The handling of the storm has been subject to much critism, from a lack of preparation and outdated infrastructure, to not enough relief provided where it was needed the most. Exactly ten years after the disaster, it was concluded that the flooding, which was the cause of most fatalities, could have been prevented with a check on the flood-wall design in New Orleans.</p>
